# GOAP

- **Developed:** 2023
- **Genre:** AI System

### Overview
GOAP stands for Goal Oriented Action Planning and is a way to design and define AI Behavior.
Unlike state machines. Where you have predefined transitions between states, a GOAP system will determine what actions to take in order to reach a goal.

This system was created during my master thesis. Were me and two others wanted to create a soulslike boss fight, minions and a npc.
The AI for the trader was very simple, if there is no player nearby his stand, he would simply idle. If a player was to come near his stand, he would run towards the stand and give the player potions, once the player no longer is near the stand he would go back to idling.
